=====

bitfs is a decentralised peer to peer combined filesystem and logical volume mangage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The features of bitfs include protection against data corruption, data compression, redundancy, snapshots, deduplication and more.

bitfs allows users to do things like mount their file storage allocation to their local file system or act as a file server to host a website. User data is broken down and stored across the entire 
network in an optimized way to achieve redundancy and high speed data availability. 

Users run a client software to connect to the filesystem as a leech or seeder.

leech
-----
A user connected to bitfs as a leech consumes the available file storage capacity and pays a fee with bitcoin for the file capacity used.

seeder
------
A user connected to bitfs as a seeder offers available local storage to the network and receives bitcoin payments depending on how much storage is 
offered. Seeders also process and maintain data on the network.

The features of bitfs include protection against data corruption, data compression, redundancy, snapshots, deduplication and more.

Users run a client software to connect to the filesystem as a leech or seeder.

leech
-----
A user connected to bitfs as a leech consumes the available file storage capacity and pays a fee with bitcoin for the file capacity used.

seeder
------
A user connected to bitfs as a seeder offers available local storage to the network and receives bitcoin payments depending on how much storage is 
offered. Seeders also process and maintain data on the network.
